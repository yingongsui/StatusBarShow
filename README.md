This is an app for monitoring the usage of CPU MEM and net speed.

1.Due to Android's notification mechanism, in order to ensure consistent positioning when both CPU/memory usage and network speed indicators are enabled, the CPU/memory usage notification has been elevated to high priority. Users can manually silence this notification if desired.

2.The default sampling interval is set to 1500ms and can be manually adjusted.

3.Long-pressing the usage line chart enables the memory feature, which can store up to 20 data sets.
